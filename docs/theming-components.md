## Theming Components

The `ui-core` components use the [@instructure/ui-themeable](#themeable) decorator along
with a [babel plugin](#babel-plugin-themeable-styles) to import CSS styles and generate theme
variables.

For details on how to theme components, see the [@instructure/ui-themeable](#themeable) documentation.
